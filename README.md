# Muesli
Muesli is a webapp that automatically generates spotify playlists based off last.fm tags

Basically it works by making REST requests to both the last.fm and spotify apis, which allows us to create simple playlists based off a variety of tags 

When I eventually get it up and running, it will be hosted on muesli.bradford-smith.com
